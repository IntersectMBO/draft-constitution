# Draft Cardano Constitution Files

This repository holds the
[Delegate Endorsed Constitution document](./2024-12-05/cardano-constitution-1.txt)
and iterations of the Draft Constitution.

## Context

Drafting took place within a word processing tool.
A PDF was exported from the word processing tools,
then it was converted to various files found in this repository.

Markdown and text (`.txt`) files stored here aim to be
[CIP-120 | Constitution Specification](https://github.com/Ryun1/CIPs/tree/cip-constitution-tech/CIP-0120)
complaint.
Some iterations of the document are less compliant than others.

The Delegate Endorsed Constitution was approved by delegates at the Cardano
Constitutional Convention.
