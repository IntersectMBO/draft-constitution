### Changes

These are a list of changes we made deviating from the PDF.

- *minimum fee coefficient* (*txFeePerByte*) -> just below issues with PDF formatting we fixed
- Fixed MBBS-07 spacing -> issue with PDF formatting we fixed
- Chose to put some guardrails all on one line, look at TFPB-01 (y)
- line 1870 -> issue with PDF formatting
- line 1960 -> issue with PDF formatting
- added idexes and header to definitions table
- We chose Appendix to be `##`Â heading
- We chose to leave new line between items in lists 

### Issues to be addresses

This is a list of small issues, mainly with formatting that should be considered for changes.

- TREASURY-02 (x) -> current wording does not make sense
- TREASURY-03 "lovelace" vs "ada", which should be used here?
- consistency with "chain" vs "on-chain"
- Naming consistency of technical/security parameter group - check line 1885 vs naming of 2.4.
- A few times there is the same heading level after one another example 1136
- Capitalization of headings? some are some are not
- The lists using roman numerals "i)" arent support by markdown, maybe change? 
- Add numbers to the headings within Appendix II, such as "1. Framing Notes" - this matches APPENDIX I

### Questions

- within the PDF "**" are used, is this meant to denote bold in markdown?
- within the PDF "*" are used, is this meant to denote bold in markdown?
- maybe number appendix two (### 1 FRAMING NOTES) ?
